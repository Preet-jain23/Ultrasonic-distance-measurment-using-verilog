This Verilog project implements an ultrasonic distance measurement system. The code generates a trigger pulse to activate the ultrasonic sensor and measures the duration of the echo pulse to calculate the distance to an object. The calculated distance is displayed on a 4-digit 7-segment display.

Key Features:

Trigger Pulse Generation: The module periodically generates a high signal for a predefined duration to trigger the ultrasonic sensor.

Echo Pulse Timing: Measures the duration of the echo pulse to determine the time taken for sound to travel to the object and back.

Distance Calculation: Converts the echo pulse duration into distance using the speed of sound.

7-Segment Display Output: Displays the calculated distance in centimeters on four 7-segment displays (seg, seg1, seg2, seg3).

Clock Division: Implements a clock divider to slow down the display update for better readability.

This code is a complete implementation of an ultrasonic distance measurement system suitable for real-time object detection applications. It is modular, efficient, and designed for easy integration into FPGA.
